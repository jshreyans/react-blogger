# react-blogger (WIP)

#### This is the first React application that I made while learning React. It uses the [JSON Placeholder API](http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/) to serve dummy data in the form of blog posts.

## Setup
   - Clone and cd into the repo folder
   - Run `npm install`
   - Run `npm start`   

Note: Redux would have been overkill. Hence, state is managed with pure React.
